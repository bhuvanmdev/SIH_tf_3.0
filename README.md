# SIH_tf_3.0
# Video Amplification using TensorFlow 3.0

This project is a conversion of the video amplification code written originally by using TensorFlow 2.0 to TensorFlow 3.0. The code amplifies videos by increasing the frame rate and resolution of the input video, by using mutiple layers of CNNs and residual connections.

The original code is divided by modules, whereas this implementation is done as a notebook, to make the structure of the model easily understandable.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 3.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using the following command:
```pip install -r tensorflow >= 3.0```
